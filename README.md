Assignment project 'RANDOM ART'<br>
CSC319 Object-Oriented Software Development<br>

OVERVIEW<br>
Suppose we take an expression in x and y, built by nesting simple primitives: <br>
product, average, sin(pi*_), and cos(pi*_). These four operations map arguments in the range -1 to 1 <br>
to results in this same range. Thus, at any point with -1 <= x,y <= 1, our expression built from these <br>
primitives will return a value between -1 and 1. By scaling the answer to a grayscale value 0-255, <br>
we can plot the function in this 2-by-2 square. (From three such expressions, we can get red, green,<br>
and blue values for each point.)<br>

OUR TASK<br>
• Using OO approach and Java to create my own Random Art<br>
• The functions used to produce the random art must be automatically generated by the program<br>
– Minimum of 4 nested levels is required<br>

OUTPUT<br>
• At successful completion, your program should be able to produce<br>
– The random art<br>
– Printout of the functions used to produce the random art<br>

HOW TO START THE PROJECT<br>
You have to start the project by run the RandomArt.class or campile and run RandomArt.java<br>
